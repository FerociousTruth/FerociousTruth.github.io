            <h2>J Thomas Moros</h2>
            <p>J is an aspiring rationalist who has been involved in the Columbus Rationality community since January 2016.  His rapid deconversion from intelligent Christian in 2013 gives him a unique perspective.  His degree in computer science with a minor in math, and subsequent successful career as a computer programmer have given him the foundation of knowledge to tackle even the most technical of subjects.</p>

            <p>He started the <i>Ferocious Truth</i> blog in order to explore interesting topics with a rationalist approach.  Topics that interest him include philosophy, mathematics, artificial intelligence, the nature of reality and rationality itself.</p>
